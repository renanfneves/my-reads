# my reads
My Reads is a WebApp to represent books on their respective shelves.
There are two pages:
- First: It is a list that shows books already in a shelf. This page is divided by three shelves `Currently Reading`, `Want to Read`, `Read`. You can move a book from a shelf to another.
- Second: It is a page to search book based in a input value. As result of this search you can move a book to another shelf.
